# rails-barebones

rails-barebones is a very basic rails app in which everything is completely hand-written in order to fully understand how a basic Rails app works. [This guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html) is a great reference.

See docs/ for more info.

Things not done compared to a generated Rails app :

- Environment specific config files ( config/environments/ )
- Initializers ( config/initializers/ )
- Unit tests
